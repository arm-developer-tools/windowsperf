.PHONY: all clean docs test wperf wperf-driver wperf-test wperf-lib release

#
# *** INTRODUCTION ***
#
# Now when we have unit testing project `wperf-test` we depend on x64
# wperf build to link tests with unit test project. This change makes sure
# we build `wperf-test` for arch=x64. This will build `wperf` and
# `wperf-test` (later depends on `wperf`).
#
# So `make all` will:
#
#     1) Build `wperf` arch=x64
#     2) Build `wperf-test` arch=x64
#     3) Rebuild solution for `config` and `arch` (default ARM64)
#
# Please note we are building:
#
#     * cross x64 -> ARM64 for WindowsPerf suite and
#     * x64 -> x64 `wperf` and its unit tests.
#
# *** HOW TO SWITCH BETWEEN Debug/Release AND ARM64/x64 ***
#
# Use 'config' to switch between `Debug` and `Release`.
# Use 'arch' to switch between `ARM64` and `x64`.
#
# Note: `wperf-test` project require `wperf` project to be built first.
# Currently WindowsPerf solution defines this build dependency and you can
# just straight build `make ... wperf-test` and dependencies will build.
#
# Examples:
#
#     make config=Release all
#     make config=Debug all
#
#     make config=Release arch=x64 wperf-test
#     make config=Debug arch=x64 wperf-test
#
# *** BUILDING UNIT TESTS ***
#
# Note: You can currently build unit tests only on x64 host!
#
#     make test                                          (Default Debug/x64)
#     make config=Release test                           (Release/x64)
#
# or more verbose version of above:
#
#     make wperf-test wperf-test-run                     (Default Debug/x64)
#     make config=Release wperf-test wperf-test-run      (Release/x64)
#
# *** RELEASE BINARY PACKAGING ***
#
# Use `make config=Release release` to package `wperf` and `wperf-driver`.
#

# By default we build for ARM64 target. Define arch variable to change default
# value.
make_arch=ARM64

# By default we build with Debug configuration. Define config variable to change default
# value.
make_config=Debug
