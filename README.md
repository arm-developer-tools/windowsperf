# WindowsPerf

## Introduction

Take the Linux perf tool and port it to Windows on Arm with the same command line interface so that you can do deep performance analysis.

Currently we support the **counting model**, for obtaining aggregate counts of occurrences of special events, and
* Currently under development.
* Will be developed and improved in short-term.
* Less complex then sampling model.

In the future we will support the **sampling model**, for determining the frequencies of event occurrences produced by program locations at the function, basic block, and/or instruction levels.

## Modules

WindowsPerf solution consists of two projects:
* `wperf` is a perf-like user space command line interface tool.
* `wperf-driver` is a Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) driver.
 * See [Using WDF to Develop a Driver](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/using-the-framework-to-develop-a-driver) article for more details on KMDF.

`wperf` application communicates with `wperf-driver` via I/O buffer. Proprietary binary protocol is used to exchange data, commands and status between two.

Currently `wperf-driver` can communicate with one instance of `wperf`.

# Building WindowsPerf project

Currently WindowsPerf is targeted for Windows on Arm devices. Both, user space `wperf` application and Kernel-mode driver `wperf-driver` are `ARM64` binaries. Due to current toolchain limitations WindowsPerf can be build using cross-compiling (`x64` host and `ARM64` target).

Currently both projects `wperf` and `wperf-driver` in WindowsPerf solution are configured for cross compilarion only.

## Project requirements

### Toolchain and software kits

* [Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).
 * Windows Software Development Kit (SDK).
* [Windows Driver Kit (WDK)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk).

Please note that SDK and WDK versions installed on your system must be compatible! First install Windows SDK using Visual Studio installer and after itâ€™s installed proceed and install WDK which must match DSK version so that first three numbers of the version are the same. For example, SDK version `10.0.22621.1` and WDK `10.0.22621.382` is a match.

### Codebase

WindowsPerf solution is implemented in `C/C++17`.

### Debugging Kernel-Mode driver

You can see `wperf-driver` debug printouts with [DebugView](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview). Kernel-Mode debug prints are produced with macros [DbgPrint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-dbgprint) and [DbgPrintEx](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-dbgprintex).

Debugging Tools for Windows supports kernel debugging over a USB cable using EEM on an Arm device. Please refer to [Setting Up Kernel-Mode Debugging over USB EEM on an Arm device using KDNET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/setting-up-kernel-mode-debugging-over-usb-eem-arm-kdnet) article for more details.

### Creating Reliable Kernel-Mode Drivers

To create a reliable kernel-mode driver, follow these [guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/creating-reliable-kernel-mode-drivers).

## Build solution from command line

```
> cd WindowsPerf
> devenv windowsperf.sln /Build "Debug|ARM64"
```

For more information regarding `devenv` and its command line options visit [Devenv command-line switches](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/devenv-command-line-switches?view=vs-2022).


## Build specific project in the solution

```
> cd WindowsPerf
> devenv windowsperf.sln /Rebuild "Debug|ARM64" /Project wperf\wperf.vcxproj
```

```
> cd WindowsPerf
> devenv windowsperf.sln /Rebuild "Debug|ARM64" /Project wperf-driver\wperf-driver.vcxproj
```

## Makefile

You can issue project build commands, project cleanup and documentation generation using GNU `make`. `Makefile` with popular commands is located in the solution directory.
Please note that for documentation generation you would need `Doxygen` installed on your system.

### Below few useful commands

| Action | Command |
| ------ | ------- |
| Rebuild whole solution | `> make all` |
| Rebuild `wperf` project | `> make wperf` |
| Rebuild `wperf-driver` project | `> make wperf-driver`  |
| Solution clean up | `> make clean`  |
