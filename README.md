# WindowsPerf

[[_TOC_]]

## Introduction

WindowsPerf is (`Linux perf` inspired) Windows on Arm performance profiling tool. Profiling is based on ARM64 PMU and its hardware counters. WindowsPerf supports the counting model for obtaining aggregate counts of occurrences of special events, and sampling model for determining the frequencies of event occurrences produced by program locations at the function, basic block, and/or instruction levels.

WindowsPerf can instrument Arm CPU performance counters. As of now, it can collect:
- Core PMU counters for all or specified CPU core.
- unCore PMU counters:
  - ARM DynamIQ Shared Unit (DSU) PMU and
  - DMC-520 Dynamic Memory Controller are supported.
- Arm Statistical Profiling Extension (SPE).

Currently we support:
- **counting model**, for obtaining aggregate counts of occurrences of special events, and
- **sampling model**, for determining the frequencies of event occurrences produced by program locations at the function, basic block, and/or instruction levels. Sampling model features include:
  - sampling mode initial merge, see  https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/merge_requests/111
  - support for DLL symbol resolution, see  https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/merge_requests/132
  - deduce from the command line image name and PDB file name, see  https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/merge_requests/134
  - stop sampling when sampled process ends, see  https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/merge_requests/135

You can find example usage of [counting model](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/tree/main/wperf#counting-model) and [sampling model](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/tree/main/wperf#sampling-model) in `wperf` [README.md](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/blob/main/wperf/README.md).

### Arm Telemetry Solution Integration

The integration of WindowsPerf and [Arm Telemetry Solution](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/109542/0100/About-Arm-CPU-Telemetry-Solution) is a significant advancement in performance analysis on Windows On Arm. This integration is primarily based on PMU (Performance Monitoring Unit) events, which provide a detailed insight into the system’s performance. One of the standout features of the WindowsPerf Tool is the implementation of the [Arm Topdown Methodology](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/109542/0100/Arm-Topdown-methodology) for μarch (microarchitecture) performance analysis. This methodology is tailored for each Arm CPU μarch. It involves the use of PMU events, metrics, and groups of metrics to provide a comprehensive analysis of the system’s performance. Furthermore, the WindowsPerf Tool is capable of [platform μarchitecture detection](https://gitlab.arm.com/telemetry-solution/telemetry-solution/-/tree/main), including Neoverse-N1, V1, and N2 CPUs.

The Arm Telemetry Solution also includes a [topdown-tool](https://gitlab.arm.com/telemetry-solution/telemetry-solution/-/tree/main/tools/topdown_tool) that leverages the WindowsPerf as a backend for Windows On Arm. This tool applies the top-down methodology to break down CPU performance into different hierarchical levels, providing a detailed and systematic approach to performance analysis.

The `topdown-tool` uses the WindowsPerf to access the PMU events and metrics on Windows On Arm, enabling it to gather and analyze performance data directly from the hardware. This integration allows the `topdown-tool` to provide a comprehensive view of the system’s performance, from high-level metrics to low-level, detailed μarch events.

## WindowsPerf Modules

WindowsPerf solution contains few projects:

- [wperf](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/tree/main/wperf) is a perf-like user space command line interface tool.
- [wperf-test](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/tree/main/wperf-test) contains unit tests for the `wperf` project.
- [wperf-driver](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/tree/main/wperf-driver) is a Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) driver.
  - See [Using WDF to Develop a Driver](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/using-the-framework-to-develop-a-driver) article for more details on KMDF.
- [wperf-devgen](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/tree/main/wperf-devgen) is our own simple implementation of tool which can install or remove [wperf-driver](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/tree/main/wperf-driver).
  - See [INSTALL.md](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/blob/main/INSTALL.md?ref_type=heads) for more details and usage.
- [wperf-installer](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/tree/main/wperf-installer) is our Windows Installer project. The project uses [WiX Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/) to build a MSI package to install WindowsPerf. This project requires WiX v5.
  - See [wperf-installer/README.md](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/blob/main/wperf-installer/README.md) for more details.
- [wperf-lib](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/tree/main/wperf-lib) is our WindowsPerf C library, please note that is doesn't not support all the latest features of WindowsPerf.
  - [wperf-lib-app](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/tree/main/wperf-lib-app) is an example application linked with `wperf-lib`.
    - [wperf-lib-c-compat](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/tree/main/wperf-lib-app/wperf-lib-c-compat) is smoke test application for `wperf-lib`.
