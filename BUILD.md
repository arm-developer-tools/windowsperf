# Building WindowsPerf solution

Currently WindowsPerf is targeted for Windows on Arm devices. Both, user space `wperf` application and Kernel-mode driver `wperf-driver` are `ARM64` binaries.
Both projects `wperf` and `wperf-driver` in WindowsPerf solution are configured for cross compilation.

> :warning: You can build WindowsPerf natively on `ARM64` machines but please note that native compilation may be still wobbly due to constant improvements to WDK Kit.

## wperf project

WindowsPerf's project `wperf` and its application require [DIA SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/debug-interface-access/getting-started-debug-interface-access-sdk?view=vs-2022) support.

You may need to register DIA SDK using [regsvr32](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/how-to-use-the-regsvr32-tool-and-troubleshoot-regsvr32-error-messages-a98d960a-7392-e6fe-d90a-3f4e0cb543e5).
If the `DIA SDK` directory is missing from your system go to your VS installer, launch it and in `Workloads` tab please make sure you've installed `Desktop development with C++`. This installation should add `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\DIA SDK`. This directory should contain `DIA SDK` root file system with DIA SDK DLL.

> :warning: You may see `wperf` error message `CoCreateInstance failed for DIA` in case DIA SDK is not installed or registered as a COM service.

As an Administrator run from the command line:

```
> cd "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\DIA SDK\bin\arm64"
> regsvr32 msdia140.dll
```

## Solution dependencies

### Toolchain and software kits

- [Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).
  - Windows Software Development Kit (SDK).
- [Windows Driver Kit (WDK)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk).

Please note that SDK and WDK versions installed on your system must be compatible! First install Windows SDK using Visual Studio installer and after itâ€™s installed proceed and install WDK which must match the SDK version so that the first three numbers of the version are the same. For example, the SDK version `10.0.22621.1` and WDK `10.0.22621.382` are a match.

### Code base

WindowsPerf solution is implemented in `C/C++17`.

## Build solution from the command line

```
> cd WindowsPerf
> devenv windowsperf.sln /Build "Debug|ARM64"
```

For more information regarding `devenv` and its command line options visit [Devenv command-line switches](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/devenv-command-line-switches?view=vs-2022).

## Build specific project in the solution from the command line

```
> cd WindowsPerf
> devenv windowsperf.sln /Rebuild "Debug|ARM64" /Project wperf\wperf.vcxproj
```

```
> cd WindowsPerf
> devenv windowsperf.sln /Rebuild "Debug|ARM64" /Project wperf-driver\wperf-driver.vcxproj
```

## Makefile

You can issue project build commands, project cleanup and documentation generation using GNU `make`. `Makefile` with popular commands is located in the solution directory.
Please note that for documentation generation you would need `Doxygen` installed on your system.

### Below few useful commands

| Action | Command |
| ------ | ------- |
| Rebuild whole solution | `> make all` |
| Rebuild `wperf` project | `> make wperf` |
| Rebuild `wperf-driver` project | `> make wperf-driver`  |
| Rebuild `wperf-test` project | `> make wperf-test`  |
| Rebuild `wperf`, `wperf-test` projects and run unit tests  | `> make test`  |
| Solution clean up | `> make clean`  |
| Create binary release packages | `> make release`  |
| Remove all build directories (deep clean)  | `> make purge`  |
